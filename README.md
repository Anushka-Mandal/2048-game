Choose the variant of the game (powers of 2 or powers of 3) by clicking the corresponding button in the GUI window that pops up.

Gameplay
The player must combine tiles containing the same numbers.
Tiles can only contain integer values that are powers of two (for the powers of 2 variant) or powers of three (for the powers of 3 variant).
