```

## Install Pygame:

pip install pygame
```

## Usage
Run the game:
```bash
python 2048.py
```

Choose the variant of the game (powers of 2 or powers of 3) by clicking the corresponding button in the GUI window that pops up.<br>
Use the arrow keys to move the tiles in the desired direction.<br>
Combine tiles with the same number to reach the 2048 tile and win the game!<br>
Press Enter to restart the game once it's over.<br>

## Gameplay
The player must combine tiles containing the same numbers.<br>
Tiles can only contain integer values that are powers of two (for the powers of 2 variant) or powers of three (for the powers of 3 variant).<br>
The game ends when the player cannot make any more moves, either because the board is full or there are no more possible merges.<br>
The score is displayed on the screen, and the high score is stored in a text file.<br>
